This section is broken up into two subsections.

\subsection{Fonts, etc.}

You can \textbf{bold} some text and \textit{italicize} others. Or, you can \underline{underline}, if that's your thing. If you want to enclose words in quotes, the left-hand quotes are obtained with the key located to the left of the number 1 on your keyboard. ``See what I mean?" It's also common to want a \texttt{typewriter} font; for example, when including code input/output. Another way to do this is by using the `verbatim' environment.

\begin{verbatim}
This
 environment
  speaks
   for
    itself.
Commands in math mode are not compiled! $x=\pm 1$.
\end{verbatim}

There are a handful of reserved characters; in order to include them, you must be careful to include a backslash:
\# \$ \% \^{} \& \_ \{ \} \~{} \textbackslash
% Notice the empty braces following ^ and ~. Try removing them to see why they are needed.

\subsection{Everything else}

Want to insert a figure (which could be an image)?

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{tacocat.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{Don't you want to dress your cat up like a taco now?}
\end{figure}
% Since compiling is cloud-based, you must upload the image file to the ShareLaTeX server before compiling. Click on the +New link in the top left-hand corner of this browser.

\LaTeX\ has the ability to reference just about anything with a label. For example, I forgot to include the quadratic formula in Section \ref{sec:math}, so here it is in \eqref{eq:quad} below. You can also reference items in your bibliography. For example, I already included your text \cite{text}. (Also notice that these become hyperlinks in the output file!)

\begin{equation}\label{eq:quad}
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}

You might want to include an enumerated list...
\begin{enumerate}
\item First point
\begin{enumerate}
\item First sub-point
\item Second sub-point
\end{enumerate}
\item Second point
\end{enumerate}
...or perhaps a list which is not enumerated...
\begin{itemize}
\item Something
\item Something else
\end{itemize}
There are lots of ways to customize lists in \LaTeX. See \url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/List_Structures} for details.
