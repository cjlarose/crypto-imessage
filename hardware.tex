The cryptographic strength of iMessage relies in part on a number of security
features present in every iOS device.

\subsection{AES Coprocessor}
% AES 256 engine, SHA-1 in hardware
At the core of Apple's security architecture is a hardware decive referred to
as the Crypto Engine or the AES Coprocessor. During the manufacturing process,
two 256-bit AES Keys are burned into the coprocessor. The first is a Unique ID
(UID), which, as its name implies, is unique to every iOS device. Apple states
that the UID is not recorded by Apple or any of its suppliers\cite{apple}.

% UID, GID
% Derived keys

\subsection{Random Number Generation}
% CTR_DRBG
% System entropy from hardware

\subsection{Effaceable Storage}
% Sucurity implications of flash storage
